## First of all we need to have a Midtrans account. Then we have to login to the dashboard.

## After that we can open the access keys.

## Make a new folder (For this case i just make a simple folder for html and php file).

## Composer init in the new folder that you made before, if we haven't install composer globally.

## Then write, `composer require midtrans/midtrans-php`

## Copy Code from Midtrans's Docs to your new snapTransaction.php file, then copy the HTML code to your new index.html file. 

## Setting the Server Merchant Server Key on .php file and Set the client key on .html file, and you can get your token in the terminal just write `php snapTransaction.php` and the result will be your token

## After that you can open your index. html on your browser and perform the testing.
